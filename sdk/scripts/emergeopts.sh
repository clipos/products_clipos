# The emerge options to be used by the "build" action in charge of emerging
# (or updating) packages from source in a detached ROOT.
#
# IMPORTANT WARNING: Do not put the "--deep" option in the follwing option set.
# The "--deep" option will prevent most of the time the emerge in a detached
# ROOT which is intended to have a different profile than the SDK. This is
# explained by the fact that emerge is going to dig too deep in the dependency
# graph (actually more than necessary to build the target in ROOT [1]) and will
# therefore want to change packages necessary only to the SDK (whose
# recompilations are utterly useless since the spawned SDK container is
# ephemeral) and which might not affect the way the packages will be compiled
# in ROOT. Note that I am not implying that any of the packages in the SDK do
# not need rebuild, only that a part of them are not necessary to rebuild for
# the proper build of ROOT's packages and those can trigger awful conflicts to
# be fixed for zero interest.
# To be honest, chances are that you are going to need to recompile some
# packages of the SDK to properly build the packages of ROOT, and this is fine.
# Some of them will even trigger conflicts due to cyclic dependency to be
# broken by hand. This is left to be fixed on a case-by-case basis in the
# target build scripts launched in the SDK.
#
# [1]: As things stand currently, it is not possible (yet?) to tell emerge to
# go "--deep" in the dependency graph (essentially to ensure that every package
# is up-to-date in ROOT against the Portage overlays configuration that might
# have changed) with the limitation to the packages belonging to ROOT only
# (with ROOT different from "/" obviously).
